G. Submitting Lab 1

The last step is to submit your work with Gradescope. Gradescope is the site that you’ll use to submit homework, lab, and project assignments. To sign up for Gradescope, head to gradescope.com and click on the white “Sign up for free” button in the middle. Use the entry code posted in this Piazza thread. If you’re already registered somehow (e.g. a TA added you), there’s no need to enter the code again.

Once you’re enrolled in the class on Gradescope, click on “Lab 1 : Welcome to Java” to submit your code.

After clicking this button, you’ll be taken to a screen where you select your repository and branch (shown below). The first time you do this, you’ll have to link your GitHub account to Gradescope (similar to what you did on the registration website). Click the “Connect to GitHub” button and follow the instructions.

Now select your repository and branch. If your repository is “sp19-s1”, you’ll select “sp19-s1” in the top box, and in the bottom box you’ll pick “master”.

Later, you can create your own “branches” (as described in the advanced part of the Git Guide) if you want those graded instead, though that won’t be required in 61B.

Now press “Upload” to submit!

Please report any issues you may have to Piazza. Entire error messages and/or screenshots are welcome.

Important: We HIGHLY encourage you to make frequent commits! Lack of proper version control will not be considered an excuse for lost work, particularly after the first few weeks.
